# üêç SnakeGame
This is a classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is simple yet fun, featuring sound effects, a current score tracker, and a high score feature to keep track of your best performance.

## üîªFeatures 
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy sound effects when the snake eats food or when the game ends.
- **Current Score**: Displays the current score as you play.
- **High Score**: Keeps track of the highest score across game sessions.

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys (`‚Üë`, `‚Üì`, `‚Üê`, `‚Üí`) on your keyboard to move the snake in different directions.
2. The snake will grow longer as it eats food (appearing as a dot or any icon on the board).
3. Avoid crashing into the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will end.
4. Try to eat as much food as possible to achieve a high score!

## Game Rules
- The game begins with a small snake, and the goal is to grow by eating food that randomly appears on the screen.
- Every time the snake eats food, the score increases.
- If the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game ends.
- Your highest score will be saved as the high score, even if you restart the game.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game elements.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for the snake movement, food generation, and score tracking.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Enjoy the game!

## Customization
- **Sounds**: You can change the sound effects by replacing the audio files in the `assets/sounds/` folder.
- **Styling**: Modify `style.css` to customize the look and feel of the game (e.g., snake color, food style, etc.).
